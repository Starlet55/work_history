1. Javascript is a dynamically typed language. What does this mean?
It means data types can change at run time.

2. What is a primitive type? Explain each primitive type.
A primitive type is a datatype that accepts a single value. It is not an object because it has no name/value pairs.
The primitive types are:
 1. Undefined: This means a variable was not set to any value.
 2. Null: You can create a variable and set it equal to Null. It means the variable is equal to nothing.
 3. Boolean: This goes with a true or false value only.
 4. Number: This is the only numeric type in Javascript. It always appear as a floating point number.
 5. String: This is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks.
 6. Symbol: Mostly used in EcmaScript 6.

3. What are operators and operands?
An operator is a special function in Javascript. Its syntax is different from that of other functions.


4. In what order does operators get called?
operators are called in their order of precedence.

5. What does it mean when a value is coerced?
It means the value is being converted from one type to another.

6. What is the difference between '==' and '==='?
'==' is an equality operator, it coerces data types. But '===' is a strict equality operator, it doesn't coerce data types.
